# Galaxie_Sanchez
Welcome to Galaxy Sanchez our game is a 2D space based game, where the player controls a spaceship and must destroy asteroids to score points. Here is an overview of the main features:

Upon launching the game, you will be greeted by an interactive menu offering three options: "Play" to start a new game, "Rules" to view the game rules, and "Exit" to quit the game.

Before diving into the action, you will have the opportunity to choose your spaceship from several options. Each ship has unique characteristics that can influence your gameplay experience. You'll also be able to select the type of laser you want to use, each with its own unique properties.

Once you have chosen your ship and laser, you will be transported to space where asteroids will appear. Your objective will be to destroy them using your ship and laser. Each asteroid destroyed will earn you points.

At the end of each game, your score will be recorded and you will be able to compare it with previous high scores. Try to beat your own record or challenge your friends to get the best score possible!
